    "\n",
    "On a Halloween night in 2035, the moon was hidden behind heavy clouds, and a cold wind swept through the empty streets of the early morning. You were walking home when the rain began to fall. At the corner, an abandoned mansion—the one everyone in town whispered about—offered an impromptu shelter. You pushed open the wooden door, swollen from moisture. The creak echoed like a muffled scream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside, the air was thick, smelling of dust and old iron. You switched on your flashlight. The hallways stretched like black veins, each step making the floor groan. At the very end, a massive portrait hung crookedly. The painting showed a family with stern faces, but their eyes… they seemed to follow your every move.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you heard a murmur. At first, distant, almost like wind slipping through cracks. Then it grew clearer: voices. Many, overlapping, repeating something unintelligible. Your skin prickled. You were not alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flashlight flickered, and in that moment of darkness, you swore you saw figures lurking in the corners. When the light returned, everything was empty… except for a dark spot on the floor, wet and fresh, as if someone had stood there just seconds ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "You stepped back, but the hallway no longer ended at the door you had entered. It had become an endless corridor, lined with identical doors. Behind the first, a sob. Behind the second, a sharp thud. Behind the third, a whisper, crystal clear, as if speaking directly into your ear:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"color:#ff3300; animation: shake 0.3s infinite;\">—YoU sHoUlDN’t hAve CoMe iN…</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The lights went out. In the reflection of your dying flashlight, you saw that the portrait no longer showed a family you didn’t know. It showed you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The air grew unbearably heavy, as if the mansion itself was breathing with you. The silence that followed was more terrifying than any whisper before. The flashlight died completely. Only the distant drip of water remained, growing steadily closer, as if the walls themselves were bleeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "You moved forward blindly, hands brushing against the damp wooden walls. The corridor seemed to twist, narrow, forcing you onward. The sob behind the first door became a muffled scream, and the thud behind the second echoed just behind you, as if something invisible were chasing you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly, one of the doors opened on its own, silently, revealing a room lit by faint, moonlike light. It was empty… except for a chair in the center, holding a black-covered notebook lying open, as if it had been waiting for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pages were covered in hurried writing, stains, and cross-outs. Your name appeared again and again, among sentences that seemed to predict your movements:\n",

    "Against your will, you obeyed. And reflected in the dusty windowpane, you realized you were not alone.\n",

    "Then the ceiling lamps crackled and ignited on their own, bathing the room in flickering, yellowish light. Blinded by the sudden brightness, you blinked. When your eyes adjusted, the figure was gone.\n",
    "\n",
    "You took a deep, trembling breath and turned toward the door. You grabbed the doorknob with desperate force, but it was locked. You knocked, pushed—nothing. The echo of your efforts trapped itself between the walls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking around more closely, you realized this was no bedroom or ancient hall, as you might have expected in a mansion like this. It was a laboratory. But a different kind. There was no ventilation, as if it were a bunker. As if someone wanted to hide something.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steel tables were covered with instruments, test tubes, and chalkboards filled with chemical formulas and molecular structures. Glass jars held muted-colored liquids, two of them labeled in shaky handwriting: “Subject 4,” “Beta Phase,” “Do Not Open.” One jar was broken, its contents gone.\n",
    "\n",
    "A chill ran down your spine.\n",
    "\n",
    "—Who keeps a laboratory in their house? —you whispered, feeling the walls might be listening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you noticed it. Where the tall figure had stood, the floor was stained with a dark, viscous, almost oily trail that spread like a liquid shadow. The stench of rust and decaying flesh forced you to cover your nose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steeling yourself, you bent down and, with rusty tweezers, collected a portion of the substance, sealing it in an empty jar. The liquid bubbled the moment it touched the glass and let out a high-pitched squeal, as if alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "You didn’t know why you were doing it, but if you couldn’t leave, the only option was to investigate. To understand what was in this place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning on the microscope, you placed a drop on a slide. What you saw as you adjusted the focus made your blood run cold: the substance was not inert. It moved.\n",
    "\n",
    "It changed shape, organizing itself into patterns that resembled symbols, letters… almost words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you could succumb to the madness of that thought, you stepped back from the microscope and looked at the jars again. What if the substances were connected?\n",
    "\n",
    "The one jar was inert, motionless, as if it had no strength at all. The other was full of life, moving, though inefficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this realization, you decided to learn more. You searched for information and discovered their molecular composition. It was time to investigate.\n",

    "## Quantum Subspace Diagonalization (QSD)\n",
    "\n",
    "This module implements a complete quantum computing pipeline for solving\n",
    "the eigenvalue problem of molecular Hamiltonians using:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Krylov Subspace Construction via Trotterized Time Evolution *(NEW!)*\n",
    "2. Variational Quantum Circuits for State Preparation\n",
    "3. Quantum Estimator for Hamiltonian Matrix Element Measurements\n",
    "4. Classical Diagonalization in the Reduced Subspace\n",
    "\n",
    "#### THEORY BACKGROUND:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Krylov subspace method works by creating a basis of vectors:\n",
    "    $$K_n(H, |ψ₀⟩) = span\\{|ψ₀⟩, H|ψ₀⟩, H²|ψ₀⟩, ..., H^{n-1}|ψ₀⟩\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this subspace, the Hamiltonian eigenvalue problem becomes much smaller\n",
    "and easier to solve. The key insight is that low-lying eigenstates of H\n",
    "can be well-approximated using linear combinations of these Krylov vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: A thing I forgot saying on the speak is that QSD also performs better with larger molecules, \n",
    "as the projections helps us to make this problems smaller and easier (smaller Hilbert Space == Less qubits for getting a result)*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### WHY THIS WORKS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $|ψ₀⟩$ has overlap with the ground state, repeated application of $H$\n",
    "  amplifies the ground state component (power method principle)\n",
    "- Higher Krylov vectors span the space of excited states\n",
    "- The reduced Hamiltonian $H_{eff}$ in this basis captures all the physics\n",
    "  of the low-energy spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "#### QUANTUM ADVANTAGE:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classical: Building Krylov vectors requires $O(N²)$ operations ($N =$ dimension)\n",
    "- Quantum: Can prepare and manipulate these vectors efficiently on quantum hardware\n",
    "- This implementation shows how to do this using real quantum circuits"

    "#### HOW WE BUILD IT ON QUANTUM COMPUTER:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Problem:` We can't directly apply H to a quantum state\n",
    "\n",
    "`Solution:` Use time evolution $e^{-iHt} ≈ I - iHt$, for small $t$ (Quite similar as we talk in the video of Quantum Chemistry, in the slide of VarQITE)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Mathematical trick:`\n",

    "\n",
    "This would be the ideal way to do it via a quantum computer (and the version I wanted to do it). Note we apply here a version of a simulation of quantum computer in a classical one. So, if we apply all of this, is going to take a few hours of our time. Therefore, in this part, we'll not use Trotterization (suzuki Trotterization) and we'll use just the matrix format (optimal value for simulation, but not quantum computing realistic)"

    "You lean over the jars, observing the liquids under the flickering light of your flashlight. The data from your microscope and the calculations you had performed with Qiskit were starting to make sense. The more stable substance, Alpha, was calm, almost asleep in its lowest-energy form. It showed no movement, no change of shape; it seemed like a “dormant” version of what it could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other, Beta, was different. Its particles jittered and constantly reorganized, forming patterns that resembled symbols and letters. Every calculation you had made—its energy to the same conclusion: this molecule was in an excited state, far more energetic than Alpha, and required a constant input of energy to maintain that state. Without that stimulus, its “living” form would collapse into the stillness of the ground state.\n",
    "\n",
    "A chill ran down your spine. It was as if Beta knew you were watching, reacting to your presence. It wasn’t merely inert; its existence depended on the energy it drew from its surroundings, from the reactant that kept it active. The instability that made it move and change shape was the same instability that could send it plummeting into the dormant state, identical to Alpha.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you jotted down your observations, a thought struck you: if that energy were ever depleted, if a reaction were interrupted, the substance would cease to exist in its “living” form. And then… what would happen to everything else in that mansion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly, you notice Alpha beginning to slow, approaching the form that Beta maintained. Observing this behavior alongside your results, you decide to call your investigation complete. But in that moment, a question gnaws at you: where does it get the energy to stay active?\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid any complications, you decide to secure the once-active substance in a new container. This time, when you pick it up with the tweezers, it neither smells nor moves nor makes a sound. You place it in a new jar and decide it’s time to leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "You stand in front of the door, breathing heavily. For a few seconds, it seems completely blocked, as if an invisible wall held it in place. Your heart races, anxiety gripping you. You think it’s locked, but when you try again, hands shaking, the door yields without resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was the mansion’s system, you think, something strange playing tricks on your mind. Fear and tension had made you believe the impossible—something that was never truly impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the jar safely in your hands, you step outside. The night breeze hits your face, cool and damp, blending the scent of rain with the mystery of the night. The mansion stands behind you, silent, as if nothing had happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wet pavement reflects the moonlight, and you move through puddles and leaves carried by the wind. The city is deserted, only the distant sound of rain breaking the silence. Each step toward your home brings a little calm, though the memory of what occurred lingers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you reach your door, open it, and step inside. You close it with a sigh, soaked and exhausted, leaning against the wood. Outside, Halloween night continues, mysterious and silent, while inside your home, there is finally a space of calm.\n",
